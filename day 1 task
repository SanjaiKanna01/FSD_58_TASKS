HTTP/1.1: The Workhorse of the Web
HTTP/1.1, introduced in 1999, revolutionized web communications by allowing multiple resources to be fetched over a single TCP connection, thus reducing latency. However, as web pages became more complex with increased reliance on multimedia content and third-party resources, certain limitations of HTTP/1.1 began to surface:

Head-of-Line Blocking: In HTTP/1.1, each requested resource must wait for its turn to be transmitted, leading to head-of-line blocking. This results in inefficiencies, especially when small resources are held up behind larger ones.

High Latency: Initiating multiple TCP connections for parallel resource retrieval incurs significant overhead, contributing to higher latency and slower page load times.

Redundant Headers: With each request, HTTP/1.1 sends redundant headers, such as cookies and user-agent information, even if they haven't changed since the previous request.

HTTP/2: The Next Evolution
To address the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 emerged as a major upgrade, officially standardized in 2015. It introduced several groundbreaking features to optimize web performance:

Multiplexing: Perhaps the most significant improvement, HTTP/2 enables multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be interleaved within a single TCP connection. This eliminates head-of-line blocking and improves resource utilization, leading to faster page loads.

Header Compression: HTTP/2 employs header compression techniques like HPACK, which significantly reduce overhead by compressing headers before transmission. This reduces latency and conserves bandwidth, particularly beneficial for mobile devices and slower networks.

Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces server push, empowering servers to proactively push resources to clients before they are explicitly requested. This preemptive approach can prefetch essential assets, further enhancing performance and reducing round-trip times.

Binary Protocol: Unlike HTTP/1.1, which transmits data as plain text, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, making it more efficient to parse and process by both servers and clients.
